# Remind Me There

**Remind Me There** is an Android app to create reminders based on geofences. You can set up custom geofences and messages, then as you travel into the geofenced area, you'll recieve your custom message as a notification on your device.

# Uses

Geofences give devices the power to monitor a circular area in the world, and let the device inform you whenever it enters or exits that area.

This has enormous benefits for apps that want to leverage location as a trigger. A retail company could send a special notification to a customer near one of their stores with a special discount to tempt them in. A holiday resort could welcome its customers via its app whenever they enter the resort.
