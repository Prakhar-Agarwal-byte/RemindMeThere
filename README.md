**Remind Me There** is an Android app to create reminders based on geofences. You can set up custom geofences and messages, then as you travel into the geofenced area, you'll receive your custom message as a notification on your device.

# Motivation

We often try to make a list of things that we want to do. Like Get groceries from the market, goto a relative's house, purchase a book from the library, etc. All these tasks have one thing in common that they have to perform at a particular place. So I thought wouldn't it be better if we could be reminded of our tasks at the right place and at the right time. :thinking:

So I created Remind Me There app. Now in the app, you can mark a location where you want to be reminded. Like you can say remind me to buy groceries when I get to market area or remind me to purchase a book from library when I am near it. :smile:

This saves both time and money because you can do those things when you are near it and not when you reach home and say Oh no! I again forgot to bring groceries from the market.
Mind me it's really a pain in the neck! 

# Technology

 - Geofence
 - Kotlin
 - XML
 - SharedPreference
 - Geofence BroadcastReciever
 - JobIntentService
 - Google Maps API
 - Geofencing Client
 - Notification Manager etc.

Geofences give devices the power to monitor a circular area in the world, and let the device inform you whenever it enters or exits that area.

This has enormous benefits for apps that want to leverage location as a trigger. A retail company could send a special notification to a customer near one of their stores with a special discount to tempt them in. A holiday resort could welcome its customers via its app whenever they enter the resort.

# Note

The app works perfectly fine for Android devices up to Android 9.

Feel free to test the app by literally going to marked place or test it on the emulator by mocking your location.
